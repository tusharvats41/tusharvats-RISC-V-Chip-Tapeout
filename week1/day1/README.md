 1. RTL (Register Transfer Level)  
RTL design is the **behavioral description** of a digital system. It shows how data moves between registers and how logic processes that data.  

- RTL is always checked against the **specifications** through **simulation**.  
- Verilog is commonly used both to **write RTL** and to **simulate it**.  

2. Design vs Testbench  
- **Design**: The actual working logic created in Verilog, which must match the required functionality.  
- **Testbench**: A verification script that applies test vectors (stimulus) to the design and checks its outputs.  
  - The design has inputs and outputs.  
  - The testbench itself has no primary I/O—it only drives the design and observes results.  

3. How Simulation Works  
1. Input signals are applied.  
2. Outputs are generated based on inputs.  
3. The simulator keeps checking for any changes in inputs and updates the outputs accordingly.  

4. RTL Design Example  
An RTL model describes **what the design should do**, not how it is built physically. Example:  

verilog
module sample (a, b, y);
  input a, b;
  output y;
  assign y = a & b;  // AND gate behavior
endmodule

5. Synthesis

Synthesis converts RTL into a gate-level netlist using a technology library.

Steps in synthesis:

Tool checks syntax and semantics of RTL.

RTL is mapped to standard cells from the library.

Reports are generated (errors, warnings, timing, area, power, etc.).

Outputs:

A netlist (.v) file describing gates and connections.

A synthesis report for analysis.

6. Standard Cell Library (lib)

A standard cell library provides the hardware building blocks.

Contains logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, etc.).

Gates may have multiple variants (different sizes, delays, and drive strengths).

The synthesizer chooses cells based on timing, area, and power trade-offs.

7. Timing Basics

Total delay = Logic delay + Net delay.

Combinational logic: Path is Input → Logic → Output.

Sequential logic: Path is Register A → Combinational Logic → Register B.

Correct timing ensures reliable operation with the system clock.

8. Cell Behavior and Design Considerations

Different types of cells (e.g., driver cells, sensor cells) have varying efficiency, load-handling, and speed.

Load impacts delay: a heavier load increases switching time.

Digital switching delay is critical for high-speed circuits.

Narrow vs. wide transistors:

Narrow = smaller area, lower power, but slower.

Wide = faster switching, but larger area and higher power.

Circuit design is a trade-off between area and performance.

Optimization challenges involve balancing delay, power, and chip size.

Notes often include block diagrams showing gates, signal flow, and timing paths to visualize these trade-offs.

9. Summary

Day 1 introduced how RTL describes behavior, how testbenches validate functionality, and how synthesis translates RTL into hardware using standard cell libraries. Alongside, we explored practical cell behavior—covering load effects, switching delays, transistor sizing, and the constant trade-off between performance, power, and area in circuit design.
